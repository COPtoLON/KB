Key Differences: Copenhagen vs. London Job Applications
CV Style and Self-Presentation: In Denmark, humility and a team-oriented tone (in line with Janteloven) are expected on CVs, whereas in the UK market it’s important to highlight individual achievements and skills more explicitly​

. A resume that might be considered too modest in the UK could fail to impress – British recruiters often advise candidates to emphasize personal accomplishments (“I did X”) more than in Denmark, where one might say “We did X” to avoid seeming boastful​

. Tailoring the CV to showcase the candidate’s specific technical contributions and results is thus more crucial in London.
Competition and Hiring Process: The London job market is much larger and more competitive than Copenhagen’s. There is a far greater pool of qualified talent in London​

, meaning each job posting can receive many more applications on average (one analysis showed nearly a 3:1 ratio of job seekers to jobs in London​

, and for sought-after roles this ratio is even higher). In contrast, Denmark’s smaller market and network-driven hiring mean there may be fewer direct applicants for each role. As a result, a generic resume that yielded responses in Denmark might not stand out in London without customization. Additionally, UK employers often use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen CVs, so matching keywords and tailoring your experience to each specific role is important – something that might not have been as critical in the Danish context.
Networking vs. Formal Applications: Copenhagen’s job market places a heavier emphasis on networking and referrals – who you know can significantly influence hiring​

. Many roles in Denmark are filled through connections or are advertised in channels where the talent pool is limited. The candidate’s prior success in Denmark (e.g. landing data analyst/accounting roles) may have benefited from a closer-knit professional network or less formal hiring process. In London, by contrast, formal application processes (online job portals like LinkedIn, eFinancialCareers, etc.) are the norm for finance/quant roles, and the hiring process can be more structured and rigorous. This means a CV faces heavier competition and is less likely to reach a hiring manager without passing initial automated or HR screening. Building a network in London is still helpful, but the sheer size of the market means direct applications must be very strong.
Local Expectations and Clarity: UK recruiters expect clarity on details that might be taken for granted elsewhere. For example, it’s advisable to explicitly state one’s right to work in the UK on the CV or cover letter​

. If the candidate’s resume did not clearly mention his spouse visa status, London employers might have hesitated, assuming he would require sponsorship. In Denmark, nationality/visa might have been less of an issue (especially if he was an EU resident or it was obvious he was locally based). Ensuring the CV meets UK conventions (e.g. no photo or personal details, a strong one-page or two-page format focusing on achievements, and inclusion of UK contact information and work authorization) can make a big difference.
Role Specialization: The roles the candidate applied for in Denmark (data analyst, accounting assistant) were somewhat generalist. London’s finance roles – especially in quantitative trading – tend to be highly specialized with strict requirements (often expecting advanced degrees or very specific skills). The candidate’s broad skill set is valuable, but if his CV wasn’t targeted to the specific role (for instance, highlighting backtesting and trading strategy experience when applying to quant research jobs), UK hiring managers might overlook him in favor of candidates whose resumes scream a direct fit. In Denmark, employers might have been more flexible in matching a candidate with potential to a role. In London, demonstrating a direct alignment with the job’s requirements is often necessary to secure an interview.
By understanding these differences and adjusting his approach — e.g. rewriting his CV in a UK-friendly style, clearly emphasizing his technical accomplishments and trading-related projects, and leveraging UK job keywords — the candidate can improve his chances. Combining that with proactive networking and explicitly communicating his right to work should help translate his prior successes in Copenhagen to the London job market
