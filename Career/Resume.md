- ```TMRW.FINANCE.returns()``` – Simple & log return calculations over user-defined intervals.
- ```TMRW.FINANCE.twa()``` – Time-weighted moving average for flexible smoothing.


## Phase 2: Simulation & Strategy Deployment (2022 – 2023)
### 1. TMRW Simulations
- **Goal:** Develop powerful simulation environments (Monte Carlo, scenario testing) for pricing, risk analysis, and stress-testing new strategies.
- **Notable Techniques:**
  - Monte Carlo Engines – Brownian motion, OU processes, square-root diffusion, and GARCH to simulate asset price trajectories.
  - Extreme Event Testing – Implementation of fat-tailed assumptions (non-Gaussian distributions) to capture “black swan” events.
  - Portfolio-Level Sensitivity – Integration of multi-asset simulation for dynamic rebalancing and factor-based risk decomposition.

**Example Project - ```mean-reversion-strategy.ipynb```**
- Walks through a mean reversion model using 20-day Bollinger Bands & 30-day Z-score thresholds.
- Details buy/sell signals when the market deviates x-sigma from a chosen moving average, referencing user-defined Sharpe ratio, 6m-return, 1y-return, and so forth.
- Contains performance comparisons vs. standard buy-and-hold.

**Example Project - ```Strategy.ipynb```**
- Illustrates a pipeline for fetching live data, identifying local minima/maxima, and placing trades via the Binance API.
- Demonstrates trailing signals and systematic stop-loss logic.

### 2. TMRW Strategies
- **Goal:** Translate research insights and simulation outcomes into workable, live trading strategies.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Mean Reversion & Momentum – E.g., strategies crossing short-term MAs with 30-day or 40-day MAs, pivoting on local maxima/minima detection.
  - Trend-Following & Pattern Recognition – Implementing Markov models to detect up-trend, down-trend, or flat states.
  - Pairs Trading & Arbitrage – Searching for correlated assets (A & B) whose price spread diverges from historical bounds.
  - Live Deployment – Achieved 13% return over two months running a Python-based strategy with real-time signals.
  - Risk Management – Incorporating dynamic position sizing, VaR-based stops, and trailing “take-profit” logic.

**Example Project - ```research.ipynb```**
- Covers advanced topics like Markov probabilities, 0-tangent detection, and backtesting different triggers for momentum or mean reversion.
- Explores multi-asset synergy, including broad asset classes: equities, crypto, derivatives, and more.

## Phase 3: AI-Enhanced Market Adaptation & Autonomy (2024 – Present)
### TMRW-AI Solution
- **Goal:** Combine multi-layered AI architectures (reinforcement learning + predictive modeling) to create adaptive, self-optimizing trading models.
- Key Pillars:
  - Adaptive Decision-Making – AI-driven reparameterization of strategies (e.g., adjusting Bollinger bandwidth or RSI thresholds based on real-time volatility).
  - Market Impact Analysis – Minimizing slippage and partial fill risk via order sizing algorithms, employing advanced “flow-based” ML.
  - Hidden Markov & Mean-Field Games – Ongoing research to predict intraday regime shifts and respond with minimal latency.

**AI Use Cases in Code**
- ML-driven “spread Z-Score” strategies (MVRV Z-Score for crypto).
- Leverage-based sentiment modeling, analyzing the ratio of long vs. short positions in HPC (high-performance computing) environments.
- Neural Net–Based Predictors (PyTorch / TensorFlow) for short-horizon time-series classification.

### Potential Future Enhancements
- Quantum-Inspired Optimization – For portfolio rebalancing or high-frequency order books.
- Reinforcement Agents – Multi-timeframe RL that coordinates short and long horizon signals.
- Macro Strategies – Integrating fundamental data, news (via sentiment analysis), and macroeconomic indicators (growth, inflation) into a unified AI pipeline.

## Select Research & Methodological Highlights
