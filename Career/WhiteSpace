Essential preparation:
•	Read the company website so you can answer questions such as:
o	Why do you want to work at this company in particular?
o	What do you know about this company?
•	Read the job spec so you can understand requirements, draw on relevant experience, and answer questions such as:
o	Why are you the best candidate for this role?
o	Why are you interested in this position?
•	Prepare 2-4 questions that cannot be answered by the job spec or company website, as this helps you to understand whether this is the right position for you and shows that you are genuinely interested in the company/role. For example, you could ask about:
o	Career progression opportunities
o	Projected growth of business
o	Future projects
o	Team size and structure
•	Look over your CV. Most interviewers will base questions upon your CV, including the tech you’ve worked with, your achievements, and responsibilities. 
•	Have the video call link available and set up prior to the interview.


Common questions and possible ways to structure your answer:
•	Tell me about yourself.
o	This is a broad question, so I tend to answer it using the following structure:
	Brief explanation of relevant past experience.
	Brief explanation of current position (could include: job title, responsibilities, tech, interesting projects, your achievements.)
	Brief summary of what you want to achieve in the future.

How to present well in a video interview:

It is worth going over the basics here! Good presentation, both in terms of visual presentation and audio quality, will help you make a good impression on the interviewer(s). Some things, of course, are beyond your control (e.g. certain background noise), but it’s worth making a conscious effort to present as well as possible.

Common client feedback:
Please see below common feedback we receive from clients when they decide not to progress with the interview process. This is useful because it shows what our clients are and are not looking for:
1.	Did not show interest in our company/this role in particular.
a.	Clients want to know why you’d like to work at their company in particular since this is a permanent position, and they want to hire someone that is enthusiastic and will have longevity in their career at the company.
2.	Did not know about the company/role.
a.	Need to have an understanding of the company/role to show interest in it.
3.	Did not present well, e.g. did not look at camera/used phone for video interview rather than laptop/did interview from sofa not a desk.
a.	Whilst the working environment is relatively casual for most positions, especially due to the increase in working from home roles, it’s important to present well to show that you can present professionally (especially if you’ll be working directly with clients or stakeholders) and to show that you are serious about this position.
4.	Did not communicate clearly.
a.	It is best to keep answers clear and relatively concise, drawing on key skills and experience. It’s also worth presenting examples of work where relevant. For example, “I have worked with Cyber Security for over 6 years, especially in X project, where I achieved X”.

Nervous?
Some people find interviews more difficult than others, and some interviewers create a more relaxed environment than others. Ultimately, it is just a conversation and it’s ok to take a few moments to think about your answer. The best way to relax nerves is to prepare, so that you are confident with direct questions such as “what do you know about the company?”


Use me as a free resource!
Finally, I’m here to help! It’s my job to help you get the most out of your interviews, and hopefully help you to secure a role you’re very interested in! Get in touch with me at any point should you have any questions, or if you’d like to do a practice interview with myself or one of my colleagues.


Best of luck.
