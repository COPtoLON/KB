# Paul will present company + position
**Exp Comp:** Company started x, grown since, now expanding into finance, because more money + good customer lookout.\
<br>
**Exp Posit:** We need a guy to take charge and develop solutions, we believe x, y, z are good ideas.\
**Note:** Never heard of a, b, c, which are the correct solutions.

# Basic questions
**What do I know about WhiteSpace and Why do you want to work at WhiteSpace?**\
I know it is: Company delivering IT-solutions with integrated AI-capabilities.
Interested: Keen to join WhiteSpace, because of belief in its future prosperity. Similarily been trying to join Capacit, before moving here.
<br>
<br>
**Why are you interested in this position and Why are you the best candidate for this role?** \
My initial and current interest in the position come from the possibility on developing forecasting engines for financial instruments.\
I believe I am the best candidate for the position based on my past experience and my enthusiasm + continued development in the area.
<br>
<br>
**Question: What's the plan for this position and the company in the future?**\
**Question: The title for the position is "Software Developer", but it was pitched as "Quantitative developer" to me, is there any reason why those two differ?**\
**Question: How did this position become available?**

# Tell me about yourself. - why are you the best candidate?
I believe I am the best candidate for the position based on my past experience and my enthusiasm + continued development in the area.

**Based on my past experience**
- Brief explanation of relevant past experience.
  - Math-stats bachelor
  - Algorithmic fund - data, patterns, market regimes, adapting strategies. **Note:** Speed is of the essence here, but I was working from a very limited setup. So reducing calculation time is the most HPC I've done.
  - LD Pensions - data, structure, portfolio management, risk analytics, simulations for risk+roi forecasts. **Note:** speed was of no essence here, the only goal was a daily update on positions and risk.
  - StatDK - accounting, bookkeeping, budgetting, project financing software. **Note:** even less need for speed, monthly or quarterly updates. Excel integration focus.
- Brief explanation of current position (could include: job title, responsibilities, tech, interesting projects, your achievements.)
  - Unemployed, IMC, slow reboot of fund.
    - IMC 1 second max reaction speed, market-making, regime switching, regression modelling, trying to implement optimal strategies based on mean field games.
    - Fund, integrating exchanges, finishing up simulations package, regime switching, risk engine, pricing engine etc. Slow progress
- Brief summary of what you want to achieve in the future.
  - Quantitative developer role and perhaps later on quantitative research/strategy, working somewhere between optimizing code for speed, research for pattern recognition and decision making for optimal risk adjusted ROI.


# Position
## Software Engineer - Time Series Forecasting & Financial Modelling 
About the Role  
<br>
~~We are seeking an experienced Software Engineer with a strong background in time series forecasting and financial modeling.~~\
~~The ideal candidate has worked in banking, hedge funds, or similar~~\
Applying techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations to predict future stock market prices.
**Question: For pricing, risk, E(ROI) or Trading?**\
<br>
**proposal:** take data in varying (increasing) sizes. Interpret. Propose decision.\
~~In this role, you will leverage similar expertise to work with private company data, developing scalable and efficient models that drive strategic decision-making.~~ \
This position is ideal for a technically skilled problem solver with a deep understanding of financial markets, accounting principles, and model sensitivities.\
**Questions: Private company data? decision-making on what? Accounting? Model sensitivities?**\
The role requires proficiency in financial simulations, machine learning, and advanced computing techniques to develop high-performance predictive systems.\
**Question: Why will speed be important? Is it to train in reliable time or to decision-make fast?**
<br>

## Key Responsibilities  

### DATA
  - Build scalable systems for large-scale financial data processing, including storage, ingestion, and transformation pipelines.
  - Optimize performance (low latency, high volume) using HPC techniques, distributed computing frameworks, and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
  - Manage big compute clusters for model training and simulations; ensure numerical stability and efficient resource utilization.robust error-handling
  - Optimize Python code for low latency (e.g., vectorization, concurrency) vs. developing high-performance solutions in C/Rust.
  - Deploy models on cloud platforms, tackle challenges in scalability, orchestration, and real-time data processing.

### MODELS
  - Develop time series feature engineering pipelines and AI/ML models (anomaly detection, pattern discovery, forecasting).
  - Implement advanced statistical methods (ARIMA, ARMA, Heston models, etc.), Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic processes, and sensitivity analysis.
  - Speed vs easily built? C/Rust vs Python - NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Stats, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn...
  - Explore or incorporate graph neural networks, genetic algorithms, DAGs for complex modeling scenarios (e.g., M&A analysis, corporate finance).
  - Focus on backtesting, validation, and variance reduction to improve model accuracy.

### OUTCOME?
  - financial modeling, accountings, M&A modeling, corporate finance, portfolio optimization, risk metrics (VaR, CVaR), long-term planning (inflation, volatility), regulatory/compliance.
