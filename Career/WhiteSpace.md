## Software Engineer - Time Series Forecasting & Financial Modelling 
About the Role  
<br>
~~We are seeking an experienced Software Engineer with a strong background in time series forecasting and financial modeling.~~\
~~The ideal candidate has worked in banking, hedge funds, or similar~~\
~~Applying techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations to predict future stock market prices.~~ **Question: For pricing, risk, E(ROI) or Trading?**\
<br>
**proposal:** take data in varying (increasing) sizes. Interpret. Propose decision.\
~~In this role, you will leverage similar expertise to work with private company data, developing scalable and efficient models that drive strategic decision-making.~~ \
~~This position is ideal for a technically skilled problem solver with a deep understanding of financial markets, accounting principles, and model sensitivities.~~\
**Questions: Private company data? decision-making on what? Accounting? Model sensitivities?**\
~~The role requires proficiency in financial simulations, machine learning, and advanced computing techniques to develop high-performance predictive systems.~~\
**Question: Why will speed be important? Is it to train in reliable time or to decision-make fast?**
