# Position

## Software Engineer - Time Series Forecasting & Financial Modelling 
About the Role  

We are seeking an experienced Software Engineer with a strong background in time series 
forecasting and financial modeling. The ideal candidate has worked in banking, hedge funds, 
or similar environments, applying techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations to predict 
future stock market prices. 

In this role, you will leverage similar expertise to work with private 
company data, developing scalable and efficient models that drive strategic decision-making. 
This position is ideal for a technically skilled problem solver with a deep understanding of 
financial markets, accounting principles, and model sensitivities. The role requires 
proficiency in financial simulations, machine learning, and advanced computing techniques 
to develop high-performance predictive systems.   
  
## Key Responsibilities  

### Data and speed? 
- Data Engineering & Infrastructure, Develop scalable systems for large-scale financial data processing and forecasting. 
- Build and manage high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure to support compute-intensive applications. Work with distributed computing frameworks to accelerate model training and inference.
- Leverage cloud-based and on-premises infrastructure to optimize storage and compute resource utilization.
- Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalable model deployment.
- Strong background in high-performance computing, optimizing models for parallel execution.
- Experience optimizing algorithms for low-latency, high-volume computations.
- Experience working with large compute clusters and distributed systems for intensive calculations.

**Question: Why will speed be important? Is it to train in reliable time or to decision-make fast?**

### Models...
- Develop and maintain feature engineering pipelines tailored for time series data. -> Implement AI/ML techniques for anomaly detection, pattern discovery, and predictive modeling. -> Apply advanced statistical techniques and data-driven insights to support decision-making. -> Validate and backtest models against historical financial data.   
- Design and implement predictive financial models using C, Rust, Python, and AI/ML frameworks. -> Develop and optimize Monte Carlo simulations and other stochastic modeling techniques for financial forecasting. -> Implement sensitivity analysis and scenario testing on private company financial data. -> ???? Utilize genetic algorithms, graph neural networks, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for complex modeling and data structuring.
- Experience handling time series data and structuring it for ML applications.
- Strong programming skills in C/Rust and Python.
- Expertise in numerical computing and data processing with NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.....???
- Experience with large-scale simulations, Monte Carlo methods, and sensitivity analysis.
- Familiarity with financial modeling and accounting principles.
- Proficiency in ML/AI frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn.
- Knowledge of graph neural networks, DAGs, and genetic algorithms for advanced forecasting.
- Exposure to private company financial data analysis, including M&A modeling and corporate finance analytics.

### Personal & Social
- Work closely with other technical experts to refine models and methodologies.
- Engage in team-wide discussions, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving initiatives.
- Contribute to strategic projects that go beyond immediate task scope, driving long-term value.
- Understanding of financial regulations and compliance frameworks where applicable.
- Knowledge of secure data handling and access control mechanisms, given the sensitivity of financial data.
- Prior experience working at a bank, hedge fund, or investment firm.
