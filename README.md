## 1. Knowledgebase (KB)
**Link:** https://github.com/COPtoLON/KB \
**Description:** A modular “second brain” for quantitative finance research and operational playbooks. Organizes market‐state models (linear regressions, HMMs), technical indicators, strategy templates (mean reversion, double‐crossover), and corporate governance docs into a unified directory structure. \
**Tech & Tools:** Python packages (edge modules), Jupyter notebooks (mean-reversion-strategy.ipynb, research.ipynb), Excel integration, web‐based diagram assets. \
**Impact:** Streamlined your own R&D workflow and served as a living “operational handbook” for strategy development and fund architecture.

## 2. TMRW (Tomorrow)
**Link:** https://github.com/COPtoLON/TMRW \
**Description:** An end-to-end AI-driven algorithmic trading framework. Includes data ingestion (Bloomberg, Binance, sentiment APIs), multi-layer backtest engines, and real-time execution modules. Core focus on regime detection (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, Markov processes), Monte Carlo stress tests, and dynamic strategy selection (trend vs. reversion). \
**Tech & Tools:** Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch), C++, SQL, R for specialized analytics; Dockerized backtest environments; Jupyter notebooks for prototyping. \
**Impact:** Achieved 13% live alpha in early deployments; formed the backbone of your self-employed quant R&D practice.

## 3. Personal & Portfolio Websites
Personal (https://github.com/COPtoLON/Personal): Static portfolio site showcasing your background, GitHub activity, and blog posts. Built with HTML/CSS/JS. \
WTech (https://github.com/COPtoLON/WTech): Front-end demos and prototypes of trading dashboards and visualization tools, including strategy KPIs and real-time charts.

## 4. Galaksim – Physics Simulations KB
**Link:** https://github.com/COPtoLON/Galaksim \
**Description:** A multi-particle simulation modeling spiral-galaxy rotation curves using astrophysics and quantum-inspired numerical methods. Reinforces your capacity to handle large-scale, compute-intensive simulations. \
**Tech & Tools:** C++ for performance, Python for orchestration, visualization via Matplotlib/VPython. \
**Impact:** Demonstrated cross-domain simulation expertise and scientific rigor beyond finance.

## 5. GoldenDice & CONTROL
GoldenDice (https://github.com/COPtoLON/GoldenDice): A probability/statistics teaching tool—simulates weighted dice mechanics and gambler’s-ruin scenarios. \
CONTROL (https://github.com/COPtoLON/CONTROL): A small-scale control-systems library for backtesting PID and state-feedback controllers, illustrating multidisciplinary algorithm design.

## 6. BasicIT, Fin, QPM, AutoSTAT
These repos house reusable modules and scripts you built for:
- **BasicIT:** General IT automation (shell scripts, batch processing).
- **Fin:** Financial calculators (VaR/CVaR, option greeks).
- **QPM:** Quick-prototype market analytics (returns, autocorrelation, Markov chains).
- **AutoSTAT:** Automated statistical testing pipelines (regression diagnostics, outlier detection).

## 7. Event-Study: AuthenTec → Apple Acquisition
**Description:** Conducted an event-study analyzing abnormal stock returns around the February 2012 AuthenTec acquisition by Apple. Calculated cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) using market model and Fama–French benchmarks, highlighting significant positive drift post-announcement. \
**Tech & Tools:** R (eventstudy, zoo), Excel for tabulation, Bloomberg for historical price data.

## 8. Option-Pricing Library in R for EnvisionRisk
**Description:** Developed a reusable R package implementing the Heston stochastic-volatility model for option pricing. Features calibration routines (Levenberg–Marquardt), analytical characteristic-function solvers, and Monte Carlo simulators. Integrated into EnvisionRisk’s risk-management platform. \
**Tech & Tools:** R (Rcpp for C++ speedups), testthat for unit tests, GitHub Actions CI/CD.
