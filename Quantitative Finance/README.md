Planned progress through development of algorithm and business

1. Successful Algorithm.
   - [x] Backtest Engine.

   - [x] Algorithm Phase 1. - A simplistic test of the possibility of algorithmic trading.

   - [ ] Research Phase 1
      - [ ] Markov Model Research
         - [ ] Run conditional probabilities on different states of previous days returns
      - [ ] Hidden Markov State Research
         - [ ] Run the hidden markov model on different assets etc. Find commonalities.
      - [ ] Mean Reversion Research
         - [ ] Find time horizons, methods and conditions that benefit Mean Reversion strategies. MACD, MA5,20,40? etc. 
      - [ ] Convergence Theorem Research
         - [ ] does convergence of highs and lows benefit in detecting momentum/trends? does divergence benefit in detecting momentum/trends? 
      - [ ] Linear Regression Research
         - [ ] What data will be useful to use here?
         - [ ] Are we looking at R2 scores?
         - [ ] Are we looking for outliers?
         - [ ] Will the \alpha of the regression be useful? 
      - [ ] Standard deviation Research
         - [ ] Is the base \sigma useful for anything other than volatility estimates?
         - [ ] Will there always be a reversive effect after a 2, 2.5 or 3 \sigma outlier?
         - [ ] Is there a connection between low sigma, convergence and a directional shift?
   
   - [ ] Algorithm Phase 2.
      - [ ] Idea generation for Algorithm V2
      - [ ] Test of implementation for various time horizons
      - [ ] Implementation test
        
   - [ ] Research Phase 2.
      - [ ] Mean field Research
      - [ ] Mean Reversion Research
      - [ ] linear regression Research
   - [ ] Backtest Engine Upgrade
   - [ ] Algortihm Phase 3.
      - [ ] Idea generation for Algorithm V3
      - [ ] Test of implementation for various time horizons
      - [ ] Implementation test
2. Clients/Customers.
   - [ ] Construct list of potential first customers for initial offering.
   - [ ] Perform initial private offering. 
   - [ ] Contact various funds to inquire about opportunity for startup funding.
      - [ ] Funding for an office
      - [ ] Funding for local server hub
      - [ ] Funding for access to markets, Crypto, Options, Equity, Commodities.
