## Expand
### Identifying New Opportunities
The first step involves scouting new possibilities. For an algorithmic trading firm (or any investment company), this generally boils down to three broad dimensions:

* Strategy – e.g., mean-reversion, momentum, pairs trading, event-based trading, etc.
* Asset Class – e.g., equities, fixed income, real estate, crypto.
* Market/Region – e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, emerging markets.

Instead of jumping into everything at once, successful companies look for areas where they can leverage existing expertise. For example, if the firm is already adept at high-frequency mean-reversion for US equities, a natural expansion might be into pairs trading or statistical arbitrage on European equity markets, rather than pivoting abruptly to an entirely different asset class or time horizon.

### Balancing Costs and Diversification
Expansion is rarely cheap:

* R&D Expenses – You need new data feeds, models, compliance procedures, etc.
* Opportunity Cost – Diverting resources (capital and talent) from existing profitable ventures.
* Risk of Failure – New strategies or markets might not pan out, potentially hurting both morale and P&L.

On the plus side, each new strategy or asset can diversify revenue streams, reducing reliance on a single source of profit. The decision to expand (and how aggressively to do so) often hinges on your firm’s risk tolerance, available capital, and the competitive landscape.

## Establish

### Development and Testing
Once the decision to expand is made. Say, from statistical arbitrage into pairs trading.\
The real work of establishing the new strategy (or venture) begins. This typically includes:

* Initial Research & Backtesting – Validate the theoretical or historical viability of the idea.
* Systems Architecture – Adapt (or build) technology stacks to accommodate new data flows, trading algorithms, and risk checks.
* Regulatory & Compliance – Ensure you meet all the necessary legal requirements (especially crucial if you move into new markets or product types).

### Gradual Roll-Out
Firms often start small. Perhaps running the new strategy with minimal capital and tight risk parameters, before scaling up. \
During this period, the team refines the approach by:

* Collecting real-world execution data.
* Adjusting for live market slippage, latency, or unexpected events.
* Fine-tuning triggers, risk models, and asset selection.
* Encountering Competition (“States” of Play)

During establishment, you begin to see how rivals (and the market) respond:
* Blue Ocean – Little direct competition; it’s relatively easy to gain market share or profits.
* Red Ocean – Aggressive competition; others may:
   * Attack by front-running or copying your trades.
   * Defend by altering their own strategies to reduce your edge.
   * Counter by placing offsetting trades that exploit weaknesses in your newly established approach.

This is where the “Defensive, Aggressive, Counter, or Neutral” states come into play. You might:
* Defend your strategy by tightening risk controls, reducing information leakage, or adapting signals.
* Go Aggressive if you see a direct, time-limited window to outmaneuver competitors—e.g., quickly scaling up before they can react.
* Counter if competitors attempt to undermine your profitability—e.g., using options to hedge out the effect of a rival’s short attack.
* Remain Neutral (or continue your preplanned path) if the environment is stable, or if you believe changing tactics doesn’t improve your edge.

## Excel
### Achieving Steady Profitability
Once your new venture (strategy, asset class, or market) is established and your firm has adapted to the competitive landscape, the aim is to excel—i.e., realize consistent, sustainable returns. Excelling might involve:
* Ongoing Optimization – Continuously tweak the algorithm (or business model) to respond to new data, changing market microstructures, and evolving competitor behavior.
* Risk Management – Monitor and adjust exposure in real time to maintain risk at acceptable levels (e.g., volatility targets, drawdown limits).
* Scalability – Ensure that as you put on larger trades or handle more volume, your infrastructure, capital, and risk frameworks can keep pace.

### Maintaining the Edge
“Excel” also means holding on to (and refining) your advantage in the face of decay. In quantitative finance, alpha signals degrade quickly once they’re discovered or widely used. A firm that excels typically:
* Has a robust R&D pipeline to keep finding small improvements or new alpha signals.
* Employs portfolio management techniques that combine multiple signals or strategies, reducing the reliance on any single “secret sauce.”
* Maintains a talent pipeline of data scientists, quantitative researchers, and traders who can continuously refine existing ideas and explore new ones.

### Feed-Forward Into the Next Cycle
Once you’re comfortably in the “Excel” phase—achieving stable profitability in your new strategy, asset class, or market—you effectively repeat the cycle:
* Look for the next angle to exploit (i.e., Expand again).
* Establish the new approach or venture with the knowledge and proceeds from your current successes.
* Excel anew, eventually building a diversified ecosystem of profitable strategies across multiple markets.

## Final Thoughts
The Expand → Establish → Excel framework is intended to be cyclical. Each time you master a new area, you use that footing to expand yet again. In the fast-paced world of algorithmic trading, you’re never done growing—either you innovate or you risk being outpaced by competitors (who, at any moment, might be looking to attack, defend, or counter your positions).

### Moreover, each step has a feedback loop:
- Success in one domain funds exploration in another.
- Failures or market shifts in one area teach valuable lessons that can refine strategies, technology, and risk management for the next venture.

By continually cycling through Expand, Establish, and Excel—with acute awareness of the market “states” (defensive, aggressive, counter, or neutral)—a quantitative firm can build a resilient and adaptive portfolio of strategies that stand the test of an ever-evolving market landscape.

# Market dynamics
We can imagine a system consisting of multiple agents—referred to as partakers—each endowed with a certain measure. The overarching goal is for each agent to maximize its own measure, which might represent profit, wealth, or another relevant metric. This is a broad framework in which a trading algorithm would naturally be a sub-problem, aiming to maximize gains under certain constraints (e.g., risk limits, available market liquidity).

Hedge funds and proprietary trading firms such as Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Citadel engage in strategies that may be modeled in part by mean-field game (MFG) theory. Each firm (agent) interacts with the market (population), exerting small influences individually but collectively driving overall behavior.

Jane Street could be viewed as seeking an optimal strategy that accounts for large-population effects—this might be reflected in a mean-field approach.\
Two Sigma might specialize in systematically exploiting “edges” that arise from aggregate behavior.\
Citadel might “own the playing field” through broad market participation, typically gleaning minimal gains per transaction on large volume.\
Other funds may focus on volatility or on absorbing mispriced risk from weaker strategies.\
Despite nuanced differences, all of these perspectives can be placed under an umbrella of large-population, strategic decision-making, a natural setting for mean-field games.

## Key Components for a Trading Algorithm
Any well-considered trading algorithm must incorporate several elements:

### Predictions and Conditional Logic
The algorithm should have predictive capabilities (forecasting future market behavior) and conditional logic to adapt to specific scenarios.

### Risk Measurements and Statistical Considerations
Risk management and modeling of potential losses are essential. A robust design contemplates the probability of being wrong and prescribes adjustments—e.g., scaling down positions.

### Strategic Framework
Deciding how and when to use derivatives, short selling, or other asset allocations requires a structured policy. The algorithm should recognize when and how to influence or “push” the market.

### Incorporation of Human Behavior
Although quantitative in nature, any algorithm benefits from considering behavioral finance aspects—e.g., herding, panic selling, or FOMO (fear of missing out)—that can dominate at certain times.

## Mean-Field Game Theory
Mean-field game (MFG) theory studies how strategic decision-making unfolds among many “small” agents in a large population. Each agent’s individual influence on the system is negligible, yet collectively these agents drive its overall dynamics. The term “mean field” is borrowed from physics, where the behavior of large systems can often be approximated by examining one representative particle in an “average” field created by the others.

### Traditional Game Theory vs. MFG:
In standard (often two-player) game theory, we might rely on backward induction. This becomes difficult when dealing with a large number of players over continuous time. MFGs tackle this by letting the number of players go to infinity, introducing a representative agent whose behavior and optimal strategies become indicative of the whole population.

### Key PDEs:
Typically, MFGs in continuous time are associated with a coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation (describing each agent’s optimal control) and a Fokker–Planck (or Kolmogorov) equation (tracking the aggregate distribution). Under suitable assumptions, an $N$-player Nash equilibrium converges to the MFG solution as $N \to \infty$

### Branching Versions & Extensions:
When agents can enter or leave the game (e.g., a new agent “spawned” under certain conditions), classical MFGs extend to branching mean-field games. This can be relevant for modeling demographic changes in an economy or repeated entry/exit in trading contexts.


## Mean-Field Game Equations (Classical Form)
A canonical MFG problem in continuous time and a state space $\mathbb{R}^d$ includes:

### Backward HJB Equation:
$$-\partial_t u(t,x) - \nu \Delta u(t,x) + H(x,m(t), \nabla u(t,x)) = 0,$$
subject to a terminal/goal condition $u(T,x)=G(x,m(T))$

### Forward Fokker–Planck (or Kolmogorov) Equation:
$$\partial_t m(t,x) - \nu \Delta m(t,x) - div(\nable_p H(x,m(t), \nabla u(t,x)) m(t,x)) = 0,$$
with some initial condition $m(0)=m_0.$\

Here:
- $u(t,x)$ is the value function for a typical agent starting at 
- $m(t)$ is the distribution of agent states at time
- $\nu$ is a diffusion coefficient (or viscosity parameter).
- $H$ is the Hamiltonian encoding the running cost and dynamics, while $G$ is a terminal cost functional.

## Concluding Thoughts
Mean-field games blend ideas from game theory, stochastic processes, and control theory. Their strength lies in managing large-agent systems where each agent’s individual impact is small, but collectively significant. In trading contexts—like those faced by hedge funds (Jane Street, Two Sigma, Citadel, etc.)—the MFG framework can help reason about the interplay between a single agent’s optimal strategy and the aggregate market behavior.

By clarifying the ideas of market dynamics, game-theoretic interactions, and advanced modeling (through PDEs or branching processes), one can more rigorously capture how agents attempt to maximize their outcomes under uncertainty, competition, and continuous adaptation.

Financial Markets

Optimal Execution & Price Impact: Traders seek to execute large orders without excessive market impact, balancing price drift and volatility (a typical MFG approach).
Systemic Risk: Large numbers of correlated strategies can amplify market drawdowns.
Crowd Dynamics

Pedestrian Movement: Pedestrians are viewed as rational agents aiming to minimize discomfort in crowds, leading to macroscopic flow equations.
Epidemiology

SIR-type Models: Individuals may adapt behaviors in response to an epidemic, and an MFG can describe optimal behavior (distancing, etc.) across a large population.
Branching Scenarios

Population Growth or Exit/Entry Models: Agents “branch” (e.g., a firm splits into subsidiaries) or leave (exit the market). This modifies the equations to handle time-varying population counts.







# Company Trading Algorithm
Any good and thought-through trading algorithm must have some considerations on the following:
- Predictions and conditional logic based on scenarios, a good algorithm, has some predictive properties and some conditional logic properties. Being able to discern some scenarios from others.
- Risk measurements and statistical considerations, to be able to consider the possibilities of being wrong and what to do if such a case occurs.
- A genuine strategical framework, so as to know when to set up derivatives, when to short, go long or when to actively push the market.

A genuine trading algorithm, must also know human behaviour. To be able to consider when to be active or passive. When to switch strategies.


# Company Structure
Some companies are centralized, they have one central algorithm, that is adapted to different scenarios, markets, assets and such.
Some companies are multi-strategy, they have different algorithms and scenarios.
Some companies are high speed, low-latency. Some companies are medium or low latency. 

The structure must be.

## Strategists
Strategists, are uncommon or higher up in the system, they are supposed to be able to supervise the overall structure of the company and the strategies

## Researchers
For most companies Researchers and Strategists are the same thing. Researchers may specialize into areas, the company needs or be generalists.
A researcher, may be a Ph.D. in timeseries analysis or statistical methods, these researchers may in turn be in charge of Risk, Pricing or Derivatives hedging.

## Analysts
For the most cases companies use Quantitative analysts or quantitative traders for the footman kind of work in trading. 
The bottom part of the pyramid, which are closest to the actual trading and handling of algorithms.

## Developers
Various parts of the firm needs software developers, some for speed, some for data, some for infrastructure, some for setting up trading algorithms.

## IT
Depending on the type of company, the size of the IT department may vary, HFT companies may have a significantly larger IT departments.
With those companies there is a focus on low latency engineering. Some on data storage, some on infrastructure.

## Utility
Like any company, there must be employees to maintain payroll, HR, company infrastructure and various other roles.
