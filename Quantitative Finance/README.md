# Main objective

**Third draft:** \
Objective: For a single particle in an open system, research an algorithm to optimize and maximally conserve enthalpy/energy \
<br>
**Second draft:** \
Objective: Optimally conserve enthalpy for a single particle in an open market. \
<br>
**first draft:**\
Objective: To earn money by running a successful algorithmic investment fund.

<br>

*Note: This needs to be formulated more precisely, with greater detail as well*

# Algorithm

Goal: Maximum Conservation of Value. \
Repeat the following process.
- Expand into new markets, strategies, or assets.
- Establish a solid foundation in each new area.
- Assess ongoing market states (neutral, aggressive, defensive, or counter).
- Excel in profitability regardless of the marketâ€™s state.
- Repeat the cycle, continuously searching for new expansion opportunities.
